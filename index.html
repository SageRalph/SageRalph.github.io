                        My research assisted the UK Parliamentary Office of Science and Technology (POST) with identifying the key concerns
                        of experts regarding the COVID-19 pandemic in the United Kingdom, used to inform POST's Areas of Research Interest.

                    <p>
                        The COVID-19 pandemic has wide reaching implications across many areas of society and experts from many
                        fields have offered their concerns and advice in response to the crisis. This paper presents an analysis of the
                        responses to the COVID-19 Expert Concerns survey conducted by the United Kingdom Parliamentary Office
                        of Science and Technology (POST). 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We apply statistical, text-analytics, and visualisation techniques to this
                        new dataset to identify key areas of concern, overlapping areas of concern, and typical responses for each area
                        of concern. We contrast the human designed categorisation schemes produced before and after survey
                        responses were collected with categorisation schemes generated by our models through automated clustering.

                        TIP combines various models and techniques to group similar items, identify naturally
                        occurring topics, generate names and key points for each topic, and visually present the items and
                        their topic groups for review by an analyst. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The tool provides a means for human analysts,
                        such as social scientists and policy advisers, to explore and navigate their data much more
                        efficiently than the traditional approaches of inspecting items in random or arbitrary order or by
                        use of constructed queries, which risk introducing bias or accidental omission.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The TIP software is a generalisation of the approach used in <a href="#expertsurvey">Text Analytics and Visualisation of COVID-19 Concerns</a>.

                    <h2>Abstract</h2>
                    <p>
                        This paper examines the challenging problem of new user cold starts in subset labelled and extremely 
                        sparsely labelled big data. We introduce a new Isle of Wight Supply Chain (IWSC) dataset demonstrating 
                        these characteristics. We also introduce a new technique addressing these challenges, the Transitive 
                        Semantic Relationships (TSR) model, which infers potential relationships from user and item text content 
                        and few labelled examples. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We perform both implicit and explicit evaluation of TSR as a recommender system and from new user cold 
                        starts we achieve a hit-rate@10 of 77% on a collection of 630 items with only 376 supply-chain consumer 
                        labels, and 67% with only 142 supply-chain supplier labels, demonstrating a high level of performance 
                        even with extremely few labels in challenging cold-start scenarios. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        TSR is suitable for any dataset featuring few labels and user and item content, where similarity of content 
                        indicates similar relationship forming capability. TSR can be used as a standalone recommender system 
                        or to complement existing high-performance recommender models that require more labels or do not support 
                        cold starts.

                    <h2>Abstract</h2>
                    <p>
                        In this paper, we introduce Transitive Semantic Relationships (TSR), a new technique for ranking 
                        recommendations from cold-starts in datasets with very sparse, partial labelling, by making use 
                        of semantic embeddings of auxiliary information, in this case, textual item descriptions. We also 
                        introduce a new dataset on the Isle of Wight Supply Chain (IWSC), which we use to demonstrate the 
                        new technique. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We achieve a cold start hit rate @10 of 77% on a collection of 630 items with only 
                        376 supply-chain supplier labels, and 67% with only 142 supply-chain consumer labels, demonstrating 
                        a high level of performance even with extremely few labels in challenging cold-start scenarios. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The TSR technique is generalisable to any dataset where items with similar description text share 
                        similar relationships and has applications in speculatively expanding the number of relationships 
                        in partially labelled datasets and highlighting potential items of interest for human review. The 
                        technique is also appropriate for use as a recommendation algorithm, either standalone or 
                        supporting traditional recommender systems in difficult cold-start situations.

                    <p>
                        Motion and gesture recognition is an active area of 
                        research in computer vision, and holds promise for 
                        applications in a number of areas, including 
                        human-computer-interaction, medicine, security, 
                        and robotics, as well as many others. Extensive research 
                        has taken place into means of extracting information 
                        from video for the purpose of analysis and training of 
                        models to enable accurate prediction and classification 
                        of the actions taking place.
                    </p>
                     <p>
                        Computer vision software libraries and frameworks, 
                        such as OpenCV, commonly include a number of these 
                        algorithms for use in research and software development. 
                        This project will compare the performance and accuracy 
                        of several combinations of the available algorithms and 
                        provide analysis on the possible interactions from 
                        combining descriptor extractors with varying feature 
                        detectors. To evaluate these performance metrics,
                        machine learning models will be trained using the output
                        descriptors and tested by classifying human motion in
                        videos from multiple datasets.

                    <p>
                        A number of different methods and technologies exist for determining the location of mobile devices. 
                        Depending on the desired usage, a different subset of these may be suitable for a given project. 
                        One of the key issues in location detection is the degree of precision to which these tools remain accurate 
                        and additionally the reliability of that data. For some usages, such as markerless augmented reality, 
                        requiring accuracy to within a few meters, typical solutions such as GPS may not be sufficient 
                        and alternatives must be considered. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This paper will evaluate and compare technologies and tools for mobile devices, 
                        such as smartphones and tablets, to accurately determine their location to within 5 meters or less with consideration 
                        for different environments and conditions in which they may need to operate given different use cases. 
                        Techniques for ensuring operability in challenging environments will be discussed.

                    <p>
                        The app is built for Android mobile devices, and is optimised for use on both phones and tablets. 
                        It utilises <a href="https://www.wikitude.com/">Wikitude</a> to provide an augmented reality interface for highlighting known asbestos locations.

                    <p>
                        The app was demonstrated at the university's student conference March 2016, 
                        and has since been taken forward by a new group of students.

                        A custom implementation of a genetic algorithm simulator in Java. 
                        The program allows for custom fitness functions and generates a detailed output log of the simulation,

                        The GUI allows for input of a custom fitness function (currently 1 dimensional only), 
                        as well as selection of population size (population is always constant between generations),

                        An attempt to make a simple Rogue-like game using VB Windows forms. 
                        The game features procedural building and creature placement, an item system, 
                        and a detailed tile description system.

                        Note: This is a very old project form my first year of college and as such is quite poorly implemented.
                        The project is not a serious attempt at making a functional game, more a proof of concept.
